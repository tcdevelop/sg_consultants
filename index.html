									<h3><span>MISSION STATEMENT</span></h3>
								</div>
                                <p>As a business, SG Consultants strives to operate according to its set mission which is informed by the following principles and values:<br>
                                  Honesty and integrity</br>
                                  Professionalism that exudes at all times</br>
                                  Unquestionable dedication to our work</br>
                                  Calculated business acumen by the company's founding Director and Management</br>
                                  Never losing focus to the company's aims, objectives and goals. </br>
                                  A commitment to satisfy clients/customers by rendering all our services within the ambit and scope of the agreed terms and conditions between ourselves and them. </br>
                                  Working towards a fully-fledged company, boasting all or most of the assets i.e. fixed assets, capable and skilled human resources, modern business services aids to enable us to perform the necessary tasks at hand professionally and cost-effectively. </br>
                                </p>

                                <p>Fundamentally it is our profound conviction and belief that the characteristics of our mission statement are, without doubt, poised to lead SG Consultants, towards becoming a force to be reckoned with by peers and foes within our chosen field.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="col-md-6">
                                <div class="block-heading-two">
                                    <h3>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</h3>
                                </div>
                                <p>Our primary aims and objectives as SG Consultants are clearly informed by the simple economics principle Vis-a -Vis demand and supply. We are a particularly focused establishment, which is obviously a very beautiful aspect about our company as we embrace fully the advent of democracy. We believe that united we stand, divided we fall, hence our credentials are impeccable.</p>
                                <p>It follows therefore that, our aims and objectives are clearly to build a powerful business that is geared for mammoth growth within a considerably short period. We do this by mainly ensuring unquestionable quality of service to our clients and customers.</p>
                                <p>It is our aim and objective, further that we shall be seen as significant role players within the trading fraternity, ensuring that people who lack services do receive such useful business services as chosen from our list of services. Our endeavours, therefore, ensure that as a company we take full advantage of the democratic dispensation and consciously intend parting fully in the mainstream economic activities of our country. We fundamentally believe that our endeavours shall contribute towards the employability of our fellow citizens as well as evoke entrepreneurial spirit in some of them.</p>
                                <p>Our secondary objectives include staying in business; by ensuring that competitive high quality standards in the delivery of services to our clients are practiced vigorously with a view to securing work for us as a company/employer as well as for our employees. We are convinced, rightly so, that our endeavours shall ensure that we add our humble contribution towards the war against poverty of our disadvantaged community members and helping establish and maintain efficient businesses. Our submission in this regard is that since the company offers quality services of a more technical nature that are more relevant in today's competitive and sophisticated society we are automatically empowering our unemployment.</p>
                                <p>Against the above background our aims and objectives can be summed up as follows:<br>
                                   Price our services reasonably yet competitively<br>
                                   Become one of the leaders amongst business consultants in Umhlathuze municipality, the entire province of KZN as well as countrywide.
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="bold">As SG Consultants, our aims and objectives are wide-ranging. They include but are not limited to, the following:</span> <br>
                                   To become one of the best companies to have emerged in the new dispensation in our country, poised to excel in all its business endeavours.<br>
                                   To assist companies through enhanced delivery of services with emphasis in business consultative services.<br>
                                   To lend a helping hand in the country's endeavours to create meaningful employment opportunities for those less fortunate than the company's founding director.<br>
                                   To include a sense of pride amongst the historically disadvantaged individuals that the business arena belongs to all of us who dedicate ourselves to it.<br>
                                   To empower the unskilled individuals, turn them into skilled individuals, hence enhance their employability or even their entrepreneurial potential.<br>
                                   To always take into cognizance the need to grow a company that is definitely set to become a force to be reckoned with within all our chosen fields of expertise.
